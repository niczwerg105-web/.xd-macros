I have some macros for xdbot bot in gd so i wanted to share them. i will update this everyday if i can. To use them locate your way to the common files of your gd. if you have geode installed but not xd bot then do it in gd or on the website. if you have xd bot then there should be a folder called "macros". move the macros you want to the macro folder. and then it should be done. enjoy.
